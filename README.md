# .NET Aspire Spin integration

This is an experimental project to add support for Spin application in the .NET Aspire framework. The project is under development, so no guarantees of stability or compatibility can be expected - but we still hope you think it's great!

You can follow the [Aspire Quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/build-your-first-aspire-app) and start adding Spin services by building and referencing the [Aspire.Hosting.Spin](./Aspire.Hosting.Spin/) project.
